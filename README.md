## Narrative
I really enjoyed Data Structures 2270. This class offered me somthing on a deeper level than I think any class or topic has ever had for me. Each week we were given a puzzle to solve in the form of a toy data structure with their strict invariants, and we were set off to build out the features that allowed the tests to pass. The BTrees week for me reached a tipping point. That assignment consumed me in a way that I never anticipated. All I wanted to do was work on the assingment. I'm the type of person who gets more enjoyment out of something by going my own way, versus following someone else's instructions. Therefore, the BTrees assignment gave me many paths to explore to find my own way. Lots of late nights. Many moments where I had to force myself away from the computer just so I could eat or see my family. It consumed me.

I turned in the BTrees assingment incomplete. I left off the remove function, but still ended up with a score of 174% and I promised I'd come back to the assingment over spring break or some other time when I had a lighter schedule. But the further time passed from BTrees, the more I thought about what happened to me during that project and the less I liked it. Computer Science attracts problem solvers and certain problems can consume people. It's genuinely fun to solve these problems for them and being consumed by the problem feels good and right. But something bothered me about that - during the BTrees assignment, I was being trained to think like a computer. Ultimately, it didn't matter what the bigger picture for the problem was, or the greater application (efficient storage?), it was that I was given a hard problem and step by step, I could solve that.

A question started to bother me - could there be a problem that attracted me based on it's difficulty, in which the application was unethical? Could my desire to solve problems be used as a way to do evil things by other people? This bothered me and for the rest of the class, I kept the assignments at arm's length. They were still fun but I wouldn't allow myself to be consumed by them. My life was my life, after all.

But still, the idea of data structures seemed powerful to me. It was a way to create a universe of rules in which amazing things were possible...
