## Abstract
The T Tree data structure aims to blend human cognitive behaviors with data management, emulating learning, memory, focus, and the satisfaction that comes along with skill mastery. This readme discusses the T Treeâ€™s framework, its invariants and unique constraints, and potential interdisciplinary applications. I've also included a narrative about my thought process as to why I wanted to build this in the first place.

## Narrative
This was my final project for CU's CSPB 2270 Data Structures in spring 2024. This class offered me something on a deeper level than I think any class or topic has ever had for me. Each week, we were given a puzzle to solve in the form of a toy data structure with their strict invariants, and we were set off to build out the features that allowed the tests to pass. Not to mention, the lectures were extremely succinct and quick to watch. I could spend less than hour watching the weekly lectures and be on my way, with a compass and a basic idea of where I needed to go.

The BTrees week, for me, reached a tipping point. That assignment consumed me in a way that I never anticipated. All I wanted to do was work on it. I'm the type of person who gets more enjoyment out of something by going my own way, versus following someone else's instructions. I'd much rather turn in something wrong than something I didn't have to think to complete. Therefore, the BTrees assignment gave me many paths to explore to make it feel like an adventure. Lots of late nights. Many moments where I had to force myself away from the computer just so I could eat or see my family. It consumed me.

I turned in the BTrees assingment incomplete. I left off the remove function, but still ended up with a score with well over 100% and I promised I'd come back to the assingment over spring break or some other time when I had a lighter schedule. But the further time passed from BTrees, the more I thought about what happened to me during that project and the less I liked it. Computer Science attracts problem solvers and certain problems can consume people. It's genuinely fun to solve these problems for them and being consumed by the problem feels good and right. But something bothered me about that - during the BTrees assignment, I was being trained to think like a computer. Ultimately, it didn't matter what the bigger picture for the problem was, or the greater application (efficient storage?), it was that I was given a hard problem and step by step, I could solve that.

A question started to bother me - could there be a problem that attracted me based on it's difficulty, in which the application was unethical? Could my desire to solve problems be used as a way to do evil things by other people? These questions seemed a bit dramatic, but it bothered me and for the rest of the class, I kept the assignments at arm's length. They were still fun but I wouldn't allow myself to be consumed by them. My life was my life, after all. I wasn't a computer.

But still, the idea of data structures seemed powerful to me. It was a way to create a universe of rules in which amazing things were possible...
- (ADT week, thinking about various interesting DS - population tracker to see if desparation or excess are too extreme, ADT of ADTs that determines a computer's "emotional state" based on how many calculations it is currently performing in a given ADT, or a way to teach a computer how to think like a person)
- (Jack of all tradesism)
- (Bridging computer desires with human desires)
- (Efficient vs Optimal, ie efficent workday vs optimal workday)
- (Human memory, is optimal better than efficient?)
