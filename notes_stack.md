# Notes, next steps, etc

- [x] Figure out why add talent nodes is duplicating nodes when shifting
- [ ] determine how relearn is calculated
- [ ] determine how burnout is dealt and how it is removed in talentnode
- [ ] brush up tests to pass
- [x] circular dependency pulling TalentNode class into task_node.py. should TalentNode own all the talent node functionality as well? refactor in order because I can't set or get the task_head in the current layout
